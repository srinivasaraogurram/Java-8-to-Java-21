In the Java release model, **Long Term Support (LTS)** versions are particularly important for developers because they provide extended support and stability. These LTS versions are typically released every three years and are maintained with security updates and bug fixes for a longer period compared to non-LTS releases.

### Current LTS Versions of Java:
As of 2023, the following LTS versions of Java are actively supported:

1. **Java 8 (LTS)**
   - Released in March 2014.
   - Extended Long-Term Support (ELTS) ended on December 31, 2020.
   - Oracle provides commercial support until December 2025 for paid customers.

2. **Java 11 (LTS)**
   - Released in September 2018.
   - Supported by Oracle until September 2026.
   - Widely adopted due to its long-term support and modern features like JShell, HTTP/2 client, and improved garbage collection.

3. **Java 17 (LTS)**
   - Released in September 2021.
   - Supported by Oracle until September 2029.
   - Includes significant improvements such as sealed classes, pattern matching, virtual threads, and more.

4. **Java 21 (LTS)**
   - Released in September 2023.
   - Supported by Oracle until September 2031.
   - Introduces new features like vector API, pattern matching for switch expressions, and more.

### Key Points for Developers:
- **Focus on LTS Versions**: Developers should prioritize LTS versions for production environments due to their extended support and stability.
- **Adopt Modern Features**: While LTS versions are stable, developers can also explore newer features in non-LTS versions if needed, but ensure compatibility and testing.
- **Regular Updates**: Even within LTS versions, developers should apply regular security patches and updates provided by vendors.

### Summary Table:
| **LTS Version** | **Release Date** | **End of Support** | **Key Features**                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Java 8           | March 2014        | December 2025      | Lambdas, Streams, Optional, CompletableFuture, New Date/Time APIs                 |
| Java 11          | September 2018    | September 2026     | JShell, HTTP/2 Client, Improved Garbage Collection, Local Variable Type Inference |
| Java 17          | September 2021    | September 2029     | Sealed Classes, Pattern Matching, Virtual Threads, Vector API                     |
| Java 21          | September 2023    | September 2031     | Vector API, Pattern Matching Enhancements, Switch Expressions                     |

### Recommendation:
For most developers, **Java 17** is currently the most widely adopted LTS version, offering a balance between modern features and long-term support. However, **Java 21** is the latest LTS version and should be considered for new projects that require the latest features and enhancements.
