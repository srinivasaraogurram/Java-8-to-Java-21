**Java Release Model**

- Java is an open-source language and is managed under the OpenJDK project.
  - Java 7 was the first version that was released under the open-source license.
- The OpenJDK project is maintained by Oracle, Red Hat, and the community.
- There are different OpenJDK providers:
  - Oracle, Eclipse Adoptium (Temurin), Amazon (Corretto), Azul Systems (Zulu), IBM, Microsoft, Red Hat, and SAP.
- All of these vendors have the concept of LTS (Long Term Support) releases.
- Primary applications run on these LTS releases even though new Java versions are released every 6 months.
